# FrontEnd Notes

We have installed **react-bootstrap** and **react-icons** by running the command `npm i react-bootstrap react-icons`. In order to use react-bootstrap we also need to install the bootstrap package `npm i bootstrap`. In `main.jsx` file we have imported bootstrap for react `import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css'`.
